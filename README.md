# chatgpt-discord-bot
This bot is written in C# and the initial code was actually generated by ChatGPT.

## Creating the Bot - According to GPT
Below are the instructions provided by ChatGPT to set this up and host it.

### Step 1: Obtain the Discord Bot Token

Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.

Under the application, navigate to the "Bot" section and create a bot for your application.

Note down the bot token, as you'll need it later to authenticate your bot with Discord.

### Step 2: Obtain the OpenAI API Key

Sign up for OpenAI's GPT-3 API and obtain your API key. This key will be used to authenticate API calls to the ChatGPT model.

### Step 3: Create a New C# Project

(this is where ChatGPT told me the code needed, Nuget dependencies etc, but you can just clone this repository instead!)

### Step 4: Set Up Azure and Deploy the Bot

Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Microsoft account.

Click on "Create a resource" and search for "Web App."

Click on "Web App" and fill in the required details, such as the resource group, name, and operating system for your Web App. Choose a region close to your target audience for better performance.

Click "Create" to create the Azure Web App.

Once the Web App is created, go to the Web App's "Deployment Center" in the Azure portal.
Choose the deployment method that best suits your needs. Common options include GitHub, Azure Repos, or Local Git. Set up the deployment source with your Discord bot code repository.

Follow the deployment instructions to deploy your Discord bot code to the Azure Web App.

## Creating the Bot - According to Me

Note that Step 2 requires a paid subscription through https://openai.com/

You will also need a discord account to test it all out of course.

In addition, you should set your keys as environment variables on your deployed app, so that the IConfiguration can pick them up. See the code for the two keys needed (one for Discord, one for OpenAI)
